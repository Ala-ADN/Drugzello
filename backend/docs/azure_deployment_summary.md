# Azure Deployment for Drugzello ML Backend

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of Azure deployment capabilities for the Drugzello ML Backend. The setup includes containerization with Docker, deployment to Azure Container Apps, and configuration of Nginx as a reverse proxy.

## Implemented Features

1. **Azure-Optimized Docker Configuration**:
   - Multi-stage build for smaller image size
   - Production-ready Dockerfile with security enhancements
   - Health check endpoint for container monitoring

2. **Nginx Integration**:
   - Configured as a reverse proxy
   - TLS/SSL support
   - Rate limiting for API endpoints
   - HTTP to HTTPS redirection

3. **Azure Container Apps Deployment**:
   - Scaling configuration (1-5 replicas)
   - Resource allocation (CPU/memory)
   - Health probes

4. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Azure Monitor integration
   - Application Insights setup
   - Log Analytics workspace configuration
   - CPU and memory usage alerts

5. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Non-root user for container
   - SSL/TLS configuration
   - Security headers in Nginx
   - Azure Key Vault integration (configured)

6. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Proper .env file setup in backend root
   - Azure-specific environment variables

7. **Cloud Deployment Configuration**:
   - YAML-based configuration
   - Support for multiple deployment scenarios

8. **Deployment Scripts**:
   - Bash and Batch scripts for deployment automation
   - SSL certificate generation
   - Monitoring setup

## Project Structure Changes

- Moved executable shell and batch scripts to `backend/azure/`
- Created proper backend `main.py` with production features
- Added Azure-specific Docker and docker-compose files
- Created dedicated Nginx configuration
- Added deployment documentation

## Configuration Files

1. **Dockerfile.azure**: Optimized for production deployment to Azure
2. **nginx/nginx.conf**: Nginx configuration with SSL and rate limiting
3. **docker-compose.azure.yml**: Docker Compose for Azure deployment
4. **azure/**: Deployment automation scripts
5. **configs/cloud_deployment_config.yaml**: Cloud-specific configuration
6. **docs/azure_deployment_guide.md**: Comprehensive deployment guide

## Usage

To deploy the application to Azure:

1. Configure environment variables in `.env`
2. Run the deployment script:
   ```bash
   ./backend/azure/deploy-azure.sh
   ```
   or on Windows:
   ```batch
   backend\azure\deploy-azure.bat
   ```

## Future Enhancements

1. Azure Database integration
2. Automated CI/CD pipeline
3. Blue-green deployment support
4. Custom domain configuration
5. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) deployment option
